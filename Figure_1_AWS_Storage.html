<div>Figure 1 AWS Storage pattern decision matrix (AWS Blogs).</div><div>In this section, we will provide a deeper look into the storage patterns
offered by AWS and analyze which use cases benefit from each storage
solution. The objective is to ensure readers can make informed decisions
when architecting their data management strategy in the AWS cloud.</div><h2 data-label="san-storage-area-network" class="ltx_title_subsection">SAN (Storage Area Network)</h2><ul><li><b>What it is</b> : SAN is a high-speed network that provides
block-level storage to applications. The storage is accessed over
dedicated high-performance networks, ensuring low latency and high
throughput.</li><li><b>Best suited for</b> : Applications requiring high-performance
storage, such as databases or transactional systems, which need
low-latency, high-throughput access to storage.</li><li><b>AWS Services</b> :</li><li><b>Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</b> provides block storage
that can be attached to EC2 instances and used similarly to SAN
storage in traditional on-premises setups.</li><li><b>Real-world application</b> : In financial institutions or
e-commerce platforms, transactional databases require SAN-like
performance to manage millions of requests per second. For example,<b>Amazon EBS</b> volumes are ideal for databases like MySQL,
PostgreSQL, and MongoDB that require fast, reliable storage for
intensive workloads.</li></ul><h2 data-label="nas-network-attached-storage" class="ltx_title_subsection">NAS (Network Attached
Storage)</h2><ul><li><b>What it is</b> : NAS offers file-level access, enabling
applications to share a centralized storage system. It is typically
used for applications that require file sharing across different
systems.</li><li><b>Best suited for</b> : Applications where multiple servers or users
need access to shared files, such as content management systems, home
directories, or web servers.</li><li><b>AWS Services</b> :</li><li><b>Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)</b> provides scalable file
storage that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances
simultaneously. It offers high availability and durability, making
it a preferred choice for enterprise applications.</li><li><b>Amazon FSx</b> supports Windows-based and Lustre file systems,
ideal for users needing compatibility with existing NAS systems.</li><li><b>Real-world application</b> : Enterprises that run shared web
servers, media workflows, or big data processing workloads benefit
from <b>EFS</b> and <b>FSx</b> . For example, <b>Amazon EFS</b> is widely used in scenarios where applications need to access shared
file systems from multiple availability zones.</li></ul><h2 data-label="object-storage" class="ltx_title_subsection">Object Storage</h2><ul><li><b>What it is</b> : Object storage manages unstructured data like
media files, backups, or archives. Instead of using traditional file
hierarchies, object storage uses metadata and unique identifiers,
making it scalable and efficient for vast amounts of data.</li><li><b>Best suited for</b> : Applications where vast amounts of
unstructured data, such as images, videos, logs, or backups, need to
be stored and retrieved with scalability and durability.</li><li><b>AWS Services</b> :</li><li><b>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)</b> is the foundational
object storage service that provides unlimited scalability and
99.999999999% durability. It is ideal for storing backups, data
archives, and substantial amounts of unstructured data.</li><li><b>Amazon S3 Glacier</b> offers low-cost archival storage,
designed for long-term data retention and retrieval at varying
speeds.</li><li><b>Real-world application</b> : Media streaming services, where
videos are stored in S3 for global distribution, benefit from object
storage. Additionally, organizations that need to store backup and
archival data long-term leverage <b>Amazon S3 Glacier</b> for
low-cost storage solutions.</li></ul><h2 data-label="decision-making-criteria" class="ltx_title_subsection">Decision-Making Criteria</h2><div>Each of these AWS storage solutions plays a distinct role, and the
decision to use SAN, NAS, or object storage should consider the
following key criteria:</div><ol><li><b>Performance Requirements</b> :</li><li>High-performance applications like databases or virtual desktops
benefit from <b>Amazon EBS</b> , which provides fast, low-latency
access to block storage (SAN-like performance).</li><li>Applications needing frequent access to shared files across
distributed instances perform best with <b>Amazon EFS</b> or<b>Amazon FSx</b> (NAS-like services).</li><li>Workloads requiring high durability and scalability but less
frequent access to data, such as backups or media content delivery,
are ideal candidates for <b>Amazon S3</b> or <b>S3 Glacier</b> .</li><li><b>Access Protocols</b> :</li><li>Applications using block storage protocols like iSCSI or Fibre
Channel work well with <b>EBS</b> , as it supports these
lower-level block interactions.</li><li>File-based protocols such as NFS or SMB are best served by<b>Amazon EFS</b> or <b>FSx</b> . For example, <b>FSx for
Windows File Server</b> is ideal for enterprise applications needing
Windows-compatible file systems.</li><li>HTTP or REST APIs are used to interact with <b>Amazon S3</b> object storage, which is ideal for web-based applications, mobile
apps, and data lakes.</li><li><b>Scalability and Durability</b> :</li><li><b>Amazon S3</b> provides unlimited scalability and unmatched
durability, making it the go-to choice for long-term storage of
large datasets.</li><li>File systems like <b>EFS</b> offer automatic scaling as workloads
increase or decrease, while <b>EBS</b> scales by manually
attaching additional volumes to EC2 instances.</li><li><b>Cost Considerations</b> :</li><li><b>Amazon S3</b> is one of the most cost-effective solutions for
storing massive amounts of unstructured data, while <b>S3
Glacier</b> further reduces costs for long-term archival.</li><li>For active workloads requiring constant data interaction,<b>EFS</b> and <b>FSx</b> offer cost-effective options compared
to setting up custom file-sharing systems.</li></ol><h2 data-label="wrap-up" class="ltx_title_subsection">Wrap up</h2><div>In conclusion, selecting the correct AWS storage solution is contingent
upon understanding the application’s requirements in terms of
performance, scalability, and supported access protocols. The<b>Storage Pattern Decision Matrix</b> serves as a guide to identify
which AWS service aligns best with specific needs—whether it is
blocking storage through <b>Amazon EBS</b> , file storage with<b>EFS/FSx</b> , or object storage via <b>Amazon S3</b> . By choosing
the right storage type, organizations can optimize performance, control
costs, and scale effectively within the AWS environment.</div>
