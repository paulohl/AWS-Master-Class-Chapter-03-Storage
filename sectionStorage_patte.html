<h1 data-label="storage-pattern-decision-matrix" class="ltx_title_section">Storage pattern decision
matrix</h1><div>Selecting the most suitable storage pattern within the AWS ecosystem
depends on a variety of factors, including <b>performance,
scalability, security</b> , and, most importantly, <b>access protocols</b> supported by applications. AWS offers different storage options like<b>SAN (Storage Area Network), NAS (Network Attached Storage),</b> and<b>Object Storage</b> to accommodate a range of needs. Each of these
storage types has unique advantages and limitations, which are primarily
dictated by the protocols they support.<b>Figure 1</b> illustrates the way on-premises users and applications
connect to and access data storage systems. In this example,
applications can utilize SAN, NAS, or object storage through their
respective supported protocols. While factors such as performance,
security, and scalability play crucial roles, the choice of
storage—whether SAN, NAS, or object—is primarily influenced by the
access protocols supported by the applications. Each protocol comes with
its unique benefits and limitations, making it a significant factor in
deciding which storage solution to adopt on the backend [1].</div>
