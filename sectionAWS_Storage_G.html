<h1 data-label="aws-storage-gateway" class="ltx_title_section">AWS Storage Gateway</h1><div>In today’s hybrid cloud environments, organizations often seek a bridge
between their on-premises infrastructure and the vast capabilities of
the cloud. <b>AWS Storage Gateway</b> serves as this critical bridge,
enabling organizations to seamlessly extend their local storage to the
AWS cloud, thus unlocking the benefits of cloud scalability, elasticity,
and cost-efficiency. In this section, we will explore <b>AWS
Storage Gateway</b> in detail, including its features, use cases, and
technical capabilities. At its core, AWS Storage Gateway acts as a
hybrid cloud storage service, enabling organizations to extend their
on-premises storage environments into the cloud seamlessly [24].
AWS Storage Gateway offers a range of storage protocols, including NFS,
SMB, iSCSI, and Tape Gateway, catering to diverse use cases and
application requirements. This versatility allows organizations to
integrate AWS cloud storage seamlessly into their existing workflows and
applications, without the need for extensive reconfiguration or
redevelopment.
