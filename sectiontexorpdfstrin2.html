<h1 data-label="amazon-elastic-file-system" class="ltx_title_section">Amazon Elastic File System</h1><div><b>Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)</b> is a highly scalable, fully
managed file storage service designed to facilitate the needs of
applications requiring shared file systems. In contrast to block
storage, which is tied to a single instance, <b>EFS</b> provides a
multi-tenant, distributed file system, allowing multiple EC2 instances
to access the same file system concurrently, regardless of their
location within the same region. This capability proves invaluable for
applications where <b>data sharing and collaboration</b> are critical,
such as development environments, content management systems, or data
analytics platforms.
